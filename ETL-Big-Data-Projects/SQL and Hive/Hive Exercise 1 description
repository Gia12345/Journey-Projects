Summary of data: This data need to be cleaned in a way so that it only contains class Id and title in tab separated form. Just remove first 9 lines.

Problems 

For this problem we have divided data for patents into multiple files, one file containing patents granted in one particular year.

Create an external table for Patent data set so that it can be used efficiently for queries which require looking into patents granted for given year.
Find out number of patents granted in year 1963.
Find out number of patents granted in each country in year 1999.
