These are the java source files from the case study.
Java and SQL
I was given a broken app and had to fix and enhance it.
The app is a basic credit card app that allows for updates and retrieval of data.
The program has a menu with 8 options, including exit, and one of those menus has a sub menu with 4 update options.
It also connects to a SQL database using JDBC.
Tables in the SQL database are customer, branch (bank branch), and credit card (credit card transactions).
I added three classes - the ConnectionManager to manage the JDBC connection, the InputValidation to validate user input, 
and OutputFormatter to format the output.
