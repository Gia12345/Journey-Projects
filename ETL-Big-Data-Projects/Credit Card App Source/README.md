## Credit Card Application using Java, JDBC, and SQL
These are the java source files from my fellowship case study.  
Given the broken credit card app that allows for updates and retrieval of data, I fixed, enhanced, and added error handling to the code.  
- The program has a menu with 8 options, including exit, and one of those menus has a sub menu with 4 update options.
- Tables in the SQL / RDBMS database are customer, branch (bank branch), and credit card (credit card transactions).
- I created three classes to help with functionality - the ConnectionManager to manage the JDBC connection, the InputValidation to validate user input, 
and OutputFormatter to format the output.
