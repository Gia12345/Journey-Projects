# Data-Science-Data-Analysis-Projects
Using Python for data science and data analysis projects.

Data science assessment (using sklearn / scikit-learn) - 
final code.py - code to solve original problem; 
model test.py - code used to test various statistical models on data to see which gave the best results; 
SVC test.py - SVC model removed from testing code because it kept hanging the kernel and/or computer; 
data_clean_py - methods needed to run final code.py, model test.py, and SVC test.py

Data analysis
counting dates.py - used python to read csv files and count dates in each month
