Using Python for data science, including sklearn / scikit-learn.

Data science assessment - final code.py - code to solve original problem; model test.py - code used to test various statistical models on data to see which gave the best results; SVC test.py - SVC model removed from testing code because it kept hanging the kernel and/or computer; data_clean_py - methods needed to run final code.py, model test.py, and SVC test.py

Recent additions/fixes.
Encoded categorical data using only OneHotEncoder.
Used SimpleImputer to replace null values - used most frequent for categorical data and mean for numerical data.
